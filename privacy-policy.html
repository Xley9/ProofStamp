  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">ProofStamp – Digital Evidence Protector<br>Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> ProofStamp does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data. All data stays 100% on your device. We have no servers, no analytics, no tracking.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>ProofStamp ("the App") is a mobile and web application that allows users to capture, hash, and securely store digital evidence on their own device. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>ProofStamp does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account required</strong> — There is no registration, login, or user account.</li>
    <li><strong>No server communication</strong> — The App does not connect to any external server or cloud service. All functionality is entirely offline.</li>
    <li><strong>No analytics or tracking</strong> — We do not use any analytics tools, cookies, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>No data sharing</strong> — We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The App stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>, using the browser's IndexedDB storage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos and files</strong> you choose to add as evidence</li>
    <li><strong>SHA-256 hashes</strong> (cryptographic fingerprints) of those files</li>
    <li><strong>Titles and descriptions</strong> you enter for each proof</li>
    <li><strong>Timestamps</strong> of when each proof was created</li>
    <li><strong>GPS coordinates</strong> (only if you explicitly grant location permission)</li>
    <li><strong>App settings</strong> (theme, language preference)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data never leaves your device. It is not uploaded, synced, or backed up to any server.</p>

  <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App may request the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong> — To take photos of evidence directly within the App. Photos are stored locally only.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong> — To optionally record GPS coordinates for each proof. This is entirely optional and only activated when you tap the "Add Location" button.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage / Files</strong> — To allow you to upload files from your device as evidence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All permissions are optional. The App functions without any of them (you can upload files instead of using the camera, and skip location).</p>

  <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
  <p>You may export your data as a JSON file or as a PDF document. These files are generated locally on your device and saved to your local storage. No data is transmitted during export.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete individual proofs or all data at any time from the Settings menu within the App. Uninstalling the App will also remove all stored data.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>ProofStamp does <strong>not</strong> integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect data. The only external resources loaded are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Fonts (Inter)</strong> — For typography. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>jsPDF &amp; qrcode.js</strong> — JavaScript libraries loaded from CDN for PDF generation and QR code creation. These run entirely in your browser and do not transmit data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction), as it does not collect data from anyone.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
